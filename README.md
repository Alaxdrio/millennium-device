Assistant for Millennium Blades

Currently under construction. The end goal is for this to be an all-in-one Millennium Blades assistant, allowing you to randomize your store deck, keep track of scores, and even handle timers.

# Usage

Just run build/index.html in your browser of choice. I'm using some ES6 stuff, so older browsers might not like it.
