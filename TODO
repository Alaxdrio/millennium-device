Randomizer
	Sets
		Select which sets you want; hierarchical checkboxes
		Add custom sets
		Delete custom sets (can also be disabled as normal)
	Sets can be selected, randomized individually, locked (for global randomization), or have everything randomized
	Save presets
Score tracker

FLOW:

Randomizer and timer can be used independently. Setup can be used independently, but score tracker requires setup?
